## Grocery store sales analysis  

### Description  

This data analysis project, a culmination of my coursework in "Python for Data Analysis," represents my 100% individual effort.  

The project includes:  
- Exploratory data analysis of grocery store sales data.
- Utilization of Pandas for data manipulation tasks such as filtering, grouping, and summarizing.
- Creation of visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate trends and patterns in the data.
- Drawing insights and conclusions based on the analysis, providing valuable information for decision-making.
- Creation of a report in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hanna.zborovska/viz/FinalProject_17089736247760/GrostoSalesDashboard)
